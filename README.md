# FizzBuzzKata

 Daily Kata (30min before the standup)
========================================
```
-Every day we will make the KATA (Every Day!!) http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/
-We will do the Katas before the standup.
-We will not be interrupted by anyone during this process.
-We will review and comment the katas 5 minutes after the standup (TimeBox).
-Fridays we will review the process of the daily KATAS and make proposals for improvements. (10 for preparation - 20 min for discussing).
```
```
Things that we agreed on the 15/May/2017
- We should use a git repository for this.
- We should make commits for each of the steps. e.g:
- I write a test and I pass the test and make the test fail (expected). COMMIT (Steps 1 and 2)
- I write the most simple way to make the test pass. All should pass. COMMIT (Steps 3 and 4)
- I refactor the code and make the tests pass. All should pass. COMMIT (Steps 5 and 6)
